# Presentation Transcript Accessibility Tool

This is a template for a presentation transcript website that allows users to navigate a slide deck and view a transcription of the presentation alongside each slide. It also allows users to change the font, text size, and text color of the transcribed text.

It is not compatible with mobile devices. It is intended for short-term use in lieu of a more robust accessibility tool for live presentations at my university.
